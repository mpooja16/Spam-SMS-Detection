Spam SMS Detection

This project is a part of my internship at CODSOFT. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate (ham).

🚀 Project Objective

To accurately detect spam messages in SMS data using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

📁 Dataset

Dataset Source: Kaggle - SMS Spam Collection Dataset

Features:

label: spam or ham

message: the SMS text content

Total Samples: 5,572

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

🧠 Approach

Text Preprocessing

Lowercasing

Removal of punctuation, stopwords

Lemmatization

Feature Extraction

TF-IDF Vectorization

Model Training

Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

📊 Results

Naive Bayes: ~97% accuracy

Logistic Regression: ~96.5%

SVM: ~98%

💌 Sample Prediction

Input: "Congratulations! You've won a free cruise to the Bahamas. Click here!"Prediction: Spam

🎯 Future Work

Implement deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)

Web-based user interface for real-time spam detection

Multi-language support
